## Abstract

This study examines whether tailoring the messaging on DineLogic’s homepage from accountant-focused copy to restaurant-operator-focused copy increases user engagement. Employing a between-subjects A/B test, visitors to the site were randomly assigned to see either the current accountant-targeted messaging or revised content emphasizing the product’s operational benefits. The primary metrics were the click-through rate (CTR) on the “Get a demo” button and the conversion rate for demo sign-ups. Initial results indicated a statistically significant CTR increase for the treatment group. However, after adjusting for bot-influenced outliers, the revised copy showed no meaningful improvement in CTR or demo sign-ups. These findings suggest that while strategically tailored messaging may appeal to certain audiences, a simple copy change alone is insufficient to produce substantial gains in downstream conversions. The study’s limitations—session-level data, potential residual bot activity, and low sign-up volumes—highlight the need for more comprehensive strategies and robust testing designs to effectively enhance user behavior and drive conversions.
